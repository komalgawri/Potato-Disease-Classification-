Potato Disease Classification 
A Deep Learning Project for Identifying Potato Leaf Diseases

Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify diseases in potato plants based on leaf images. The goal is to enable early detection and promote healthier crop management, which is crucial for agriculture sustainability.

Features
Model Architecture: Uses a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
Dataset: Trained on the Potato Disease Dataset which contains labeled images of healthy and diseased potato leaves.
Accuracy: Achieves [Accuracy Percentage]% on the test dataset.
Real-world Application: Can be integrated with mobile applications or web platforms to assist farmers in identifying diseases in real-time.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Potato-Disease-Classification.git
cd Potato-Disease-Classification

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
